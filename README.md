Obsidian - AI Security Advisor

Obsidian is a web-based application designed to make cybersecurity knowledge accessible to everyone. It provides a suite of AI-powered tools to help users understand digital threats, analyze suspicious content, and learn how to protect themselves online. The platform features a user authentication system, a friendly AI assistant for answering security questions, and a phishing email analyzer.

Features

User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system built with PHP and MySQL.

AI-Powered Threat Query: An interactive tool allowing users to ask any cybersecurity question and receive answers from an AI assistant grounded in a trusted knowledge base.

Phishing Email Analyzer: A tool to analyze the content of suspicious emails and provide a verdict on their safety.

Educational Content: Sections dedicated to explaining common cybersecurity threats in simple terms.

Light/Dark Theme: A modern user interface with a theme switcher for user preference.

Setup & Installation Guide

This project requires two separate server environments running simultaneously: XAMPP for the PHP website and a Python environment for the AI backend.

Part 1: Setting Up the Website (XAMPP)

Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the official website.

Place Project Folder: Move your entire Obsidian-Project folder into the htdocs folder within your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., C:/xampp/htdocs/).

Start Services: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and Start both the Apache and MySQL services.

Create the Database:

Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser.

Create a new database named obsidian_db.

Go to the "SQL" tab and run the following command to create the users table:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);


Access Your Site: Your website is now live at http://localhost/Obsidian-Project/.

Part 2: Running the AI Backend (Python)

Open a New Terminal: Open a separate terminal window and navigate to your project directory (e.g., cd C:/xampp/htdocs/Obsidian-Project).

Create Python Environment:

Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv

Activate it:

Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Set API Key: Create a file named .env and add your API key: GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Build AI Database: Run the setup script once: python rag_setup.py

Run AI Server: Start the Flask server: python app.py

Important: You must keep this terminal window open. The AI server needs to be running in the background for the tools to work.
